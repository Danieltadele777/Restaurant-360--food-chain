SQL code used
Here I gathered some of my SQL codes I used to do data analysis, clearning and exploration.

1. This SQL query is used to do inner join between 3 tables, using id order and id store:
SELECT
    od.id_order
    , od.id_store
    , od.id_table
    , od.id_waiter
    , od.id_device
    , od.date_opened AS `Table open date`
    , od.date_closed AS `Table closed date`
    , od.dim_source AS `device used`
    , od.m_nb_customer AS `number of customers`
    , od.m_cached_payed AS `Price paid`
    , od.m_cached_price AS `Price to pay`
    , ol.date_opended AS `Date item ordered`
    , ol.date_created AS `Date item saved`
    , ol.m_quantity AS `Quantity`
    , ol.m_total_price_inc_vat AS `Total price inc VAT`
    , ol.m_discount_amount AS `Discount amount`
    , ol.dim_status AS `item status`
    , ol.dim_feature_type AS `Item type`
    , ol.dim_name_translated AS `Item name`
    , ol.dim_category_translated AS `Category`
    , pd.dim_type AS `Payment type`
    , pd.m_amount AS `Payment amount`
    , sd.id_store
    , sd.dim_zipcode AS `zipcode`
FROM
    `data-analytics-bootcamp-363212.tiller.order_data` od
JOIN
    `data-analytics-bootcamp-363212.tiller.order_line` ol ON od.id_order = ol.id_order
JOIN
    `data-analytics-bootcamp-363212.tiller.payment_data` pd ON od.id_order = pd.id_order
JOIN
    `data-analytics-bootcamp-363212.tiller.store_data` sd ON od.id_store = sd.id_store

2. This SQL code used to clean and adjust coloumn names according to their functions

SELECT
date_created AS `Saved item`
, date_opended AS `Ordered item`
, m_quantity AS `Quantity`
, m_total_price_inc_vat AS `Total price inc vat`
, m_discount_amount AS `Discount amount`
, dim_type AS `Type`
, dim_category AS `Category`
, dim_name AS `Item name`
, dim_status AS `Item status`
 FROM `data-analytics-bootcamp-363212.tiller.order_line`

3. This SQL used to calculate the amount and order it descending order

SELECT id_pay, SUM(m_amount) AS total_amount
FROM `data-analytics-bootcamp-363212.tiller.payment_data`
GROUP BY id_pay
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;

4. This SQL code is used to create paired items purchased together

SELECT
  a.dim_name_translated AS product1,
  b.dim_name_translated AS product2,
  COUNT(*) AS pair_count
FROM
  `data-analytics-bootcamp-363212.tiller.order_line` a
JOIN
  `data-analytics-bootcamp-363212.tiller.order_line` b
ON
  a.id_order = b.id_order AND a.dim_name_translated != b.dim_name_translated
GROUP BY
  product1, product2
ORDER BY
  pair_count DESC;
